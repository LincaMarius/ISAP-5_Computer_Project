## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create its own version of RISC-V but with minimal changes so that the instruction format remains the same.

## ISAP-5 version 1.0
The initial version I want to be an implementation of RV32I. To this end, we need to retrace the steps we followed when designing the ISAP-3 computer.

Version 1.0 will be an implementation of the SAP-3 computer that is as close to the original as possible. This will be the reference, the starting point for creating a better version.
